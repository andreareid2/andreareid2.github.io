<p>
I am an ecologist with experience in biodiversity research and conservation genetics. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work in many different environments across three different continents. 
</p>
<p>
I have worked 'on the ground' in Canada, Ecuador, Switzerland, and Spain, collecting the data necessary for understanding patterns and processes in the natural world. I have worked on experimental fields in the Alps, managing common garden experiments to asses the evolutionary response of an invasive plant species. And I have worked in the lab, designing and implementing methods to help answer ecological questions using molecular tools. 
</p>
<p>
Now, equipped with a new skillset aquired from the GIS Applications Specialist program at Fleming College, I hope to be able to use spatial data to help monitor and conserve our natural world.
